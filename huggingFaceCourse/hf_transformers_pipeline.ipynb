This is a common scenario in real-world projects because annotating text is usually time-consuming and requires domain expertise. For this use case, the zero-shot-classification pipeline is very powerful: it allows you to specify which labels to use for the classification, so you don’t have to rely on the labels of the pretrained model. You’ve already seen how the model can classify a sentence as positive or negative using those two labels — but it can also classify the text using any other set of labels you like."

    "\n",

    "* Encoder Only: Good for tasts that require **understanding** of the input, such as sentence **classification** and **named entity recognition**.\n",
    "* Decoder Only: Good for **generative** tasks. \n",

    "### Attention Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "* A key feature of transformers is that they are uilt with special layers called **attention layers** which tell the model to pay specific attention to certain words in the sentence (and more or less ignore the others) when dealing with the representation of the word. \n",
    "* E.g. For grammar reasons it is important to pay attention to a close word to generate the right translation (You like...) but not so much another part of the sentence (...my books.)\n",
    "* A word by itself has a meaning, but that meaning is deeply affected by the **context**, which can be any other word (or words) before or after the word being studied. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The original architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "* The transformer architecture was originally designed for translation. \n",
    "* During training, the encoder receives inputs (sentences) in a certain language, while the decoder receives the same sentences in the desired target language. \n",
    "* In the encoder, the attention layers can use all the words in a sentence (since the translation of a given word can be dependent on what words before and after in the sentence). \n",
    "* The decoder, however, works sequentially and can only pay attention to the words in the sentence that it has already translated, i.e. only the the words before the word that's currently being generated.\n",
    "* To speed thigns up during training (when the model has access to target sentences), the decoder is fed the whole target, but it is not allowed to use future words.\n",
    "* Note that the first attention layer ('masked multi-head attention') in a decoder block pays attention to all (past) inputs to the decoder, but the seconde attention layer (multi-head attention) uses the output of the encoder. It can thus access the whole input sentence to best predict the current word. This is very useful as different languages can have grammatical rules that put the words in different order, or some context provided later in the sentence may be helpful to determine the best translation of a given word. \n",
    "* The **attention mask** can also be used in the encoder/decoder to prevent the model from paying attention to some special words, e.g. < oov >\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally.... some definitions. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Architecture:** This is the skeleton of the model. The definition of each layer and each operation that happens within the model.\n",
    "* **Checkpoints:** These are the weights that will be loaded in a given architecture. \n",
    "* **Model:** Umbrella term that isn't as precises and can embody both of the above. "
